 * \brief A Visual Studio needed file.
 * The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting from a DLL simpler.
 *
 * All files within this DLL are compiled with the LIBLOGICALACCESS_EXPORTS symbol defined on the command line.
 * This symbol should not be defined on any project that uses this DLL.
 * This way any other project whose source files include this file see LIBLOGICALACCESS_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols defined with this macro as being exported.
