/**
 * Implementation class for the CL1356+ card reader from ID3.
 *
 * This reader supports handpicking the card to work with. Its
 * the first reader in LLA whose `getChipList()` may actually
 * returns more than one chip.
 *
 * How to use ?
 *
 * If you do not plan to put multiple cards on the reader, then the
 * API is similar to other reader, and everything should work
 * as expected.
 *
 * If you plan to put multiple card on the reader, and then pick
 * one to work with, read below:
 *
 *    WaitInsertion() will wait for any card before returning, unless
 *    a card type has been forced: in that case it will wait for a card
 *    of the matching type.
 *
 *    Connect() will connect to the first card, unless a card type has been
 *    forced, in which case it will attempt to connect to a card matching
 *    the type.
 *
 *    getChipList() returns a list of Chip object. Theses are the available
 *    chip that have been detected by the reader. HOWEVER THE CHIP OBJECTS
 *    ARE NOT USABLE AS IS. It is required to call selectChip(idx) before,
 *    otherwise the reader will operate against the wrong card.
